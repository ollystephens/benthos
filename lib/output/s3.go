		description: `
Sends message parts as objects to an Amazon S3 bucket. Each object is uploaded
with the path specified with the ` + "`path`" + ` field.

In order to have a different path for each object you should use function
interpolations described [here](../config_interpolation.md#functions), which are
calculated per message of a batch.

The fields ` + "`content_type` and `content_encoding`" + ` can also be set
dynamically using function interpolation.

### Credentials

By default Benthos will use a shared credentials file when connecting to AWS
services. It's also possible to set them explicitly at the component level,
allowing you to transfer data across accounts. You can find out more
[in this document](../aws.md).`,
