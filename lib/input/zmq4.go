ZMQ4 is supported but currently depends on C bindings. Since this is an
annoyance when building or using Benthos it is not compiled by default.

Build it into your project by getting libzmq installed on your machine, then
build with the tag: 'go install -tags "ZMQ4" github.com/ollystephens/benthos/v3/cmd/...'

Messages consumed by this input can be processed in parallel, meaning a single

ZMQ4 input supports PULL and SUB sockets only. If there is demand for other
socket types then they can be added easily.`,
